=============

Home Automation Control Program for the Raspberry Pi

This fork is meant to take the awesome GUI that the opensprinkler project has already setup, and make it more sutable for home automation.

TO-DO:
- Metric system support
- Either change timers to start/stop times, or increates the timers to use minutes instead (24 hour max)
- Manual page should act like check boxes not radio buttons
